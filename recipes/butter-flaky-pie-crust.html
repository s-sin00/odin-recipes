        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Recipe for a delicious, buttery, flaky pie crust to use with your other recipes.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, diced and chilled</li>
            <li>1/4 cup ice cold water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Use a pasty blender to cut in chilled, diced butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon of cold water at a time, mixing with a spatula or your hands until the dough comes together; you may need less than 1/4 cup water. Shape dough into a disc, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Place chilled dough on a generously floured surface and roll out to an 11-inch circle, adding more flour to your rolling pin as needed. Carefully roll dough onto the rolling pin, then unroll over a 9-inch pie dish. Press dough evenly into the bottom and sides of the dish. Trim any excess dough and flute the edges.</li>
            <li>Lind-bake or fill and bake as directed in your pie recipe.</li>
        </ol>
